# Priceminder

This is a personal project designed to interface with Stubhub to track prices of tickets over time. It uses Django and a cronjob to handle the database and API calls, while the front end uses Google Charts to generate the graphs.

A demonstration of how it would work if implemented full-time is available [here](http://robinpollak.pythonanywhere.com).
