# Priceminder

This is a personal project designed to interface with Stubhub to track prices of tickets over time. It uses Django and a cronjob to handle the database and API calls, while the front end uses Google Charts to generate the graphs.

A demonstration of how it would work if implemented full-time is available [here](http://robinpollak.pythonanywhere.com).

## Extensions to be made when time becomes available
* Host live on a better server
* Add more events
* Implement Twilio integration to allow users to follow events and be notified when prices drop
* Create AI to know when prices are likely to go down or back up, then integrate that with Twilio notifications
